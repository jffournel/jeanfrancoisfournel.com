I am an applied microeconomist with research interest in Industrial Organization and Environmental Economics. My job market paper study studies the cost-effectiveness of subsidizing electric vehicle purchases as a mean to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.

I am available for interviews for the 2021-2022 job market.
