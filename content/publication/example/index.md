abstract: "This paper studies the impact of the \\emph{Roulez Vert} program, a
  policy that subsidized new purchases of electric vehicles in the Canadian
  province of Quebec. I explore several outcomes crucial to policymakers: how
  costly it is to replace traditional vehicles with electric ones or to avoid
  carbon emissions using subsidies, the impact they have on sales, prices, and
  charging station deployment, and how they affect consumer surplus, profits,
  and welfare. To study the effect of this program, I rely on a structural
  approach in which consumers' demand for cars follows a discrete choice model,
  and supply is determined by multi-product firms competing on prices. I build
  on \\citet{springel2017network} methodology and propose a new model for
  charging station deployment. In my setup, county-level governments choose
  where and how many stations to install in their region to provide charging
  capacity to EV owners. My findings suggest the \\emph{Roulez Vert} program,
  which subsidizes electric vehicle purchases by up to \\$8,000, to be
  responsible for 45.7\\% of electric vehicle sales and 27.7\\% of charging
  stations installed between 2012 and 2018. I estimate reducing emissions in
  this way to have cost \\$1,345 per ton of CO$_2$ and decreasing sales of fuel
  vehicles to have cost \\$39,330 per unit. Part of the reason behind these
  sizeable costs is that 62.1\\% of new electric vehicle sales associated with
  the policy came from consumers that would have chosen not to purchase a
  vehicle if no subsidy was available. In counterpart, gains in consumer and
  producer surpluses more than offset the total spending on the policy, such
  that the net impact on welfare is positive."
