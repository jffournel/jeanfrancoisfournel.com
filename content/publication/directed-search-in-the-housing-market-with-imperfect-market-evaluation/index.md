abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify">This paper studies strategic
  interactions and directed search in the housing market. Using a rich dataset
  of housing transactions in the Seattle area, we document that asking prices
  alone are not a sufficiently strong signal from sellers to generate the
  patterns of directed search predicted by theory. We observe instead that
  sellers use publicly available market valuations such as the Zestimate as an
  anchor point for strategic interactions. We find that advertising below the
  Zestimate leads to more virtual visits, a shorter time on market, and a higher
  probability of receiving multiple offers, while advertising above obtains a
  higher price. We propose a theoretical model that explains these patterns of
  directed search. In our setup, market valuations serve two goals: they help
  sorting buyers across house types, and they provide an anchor point for
  sellers’ strategies within house types. More precisely, sellers set their
  asking price relative to the Zestimate to reveal their reservation value which
  direct buyers to the correct seller. We explore the consequences of being
  over- versus underestimated by the market for two sellers with identical
  reservation value and show that being over-evaluated leads to both a faster
  sale and a higher expected price compared to being under-evaluated.</div>'
