abstract: This paper studies strategic interactions and directed search in the
  housing market. Building on a rich dataset of housing transactions in the
  Seattle area, we document several facts about the housing market. In
  particular, we observe that asking prices alone are not a sufficiently strong
  signal from sellers to generate the patterns of directed search predicted by
  theory. We postulate that sellers use publicly available market evaluations as
  an anchor point for strategic interactions. In this context, advertising below
  the market estimate signals a low reservation value and generates more virtual
  visits, faster selling times and a higher probability of receiving multiple
  offers, while advertising above obtains a higher price. We propose an
  improvement to Albrecht et al. (2016) model which reconcile their theory with
  facts from our data. In our setup, market evaluations imperfectly measure
  sellers’ reservation values, and sellers use the asking price as an
  information revelation mechanism to direct buyers to the correct seller. We
  explore the consequences of being over- versus underestimated for two sellers
  with the same reservation value and show that being over-evaluated by the
  market leads to both a faster sale and a higher expected price compared to
  being under-evaluated.
