abstract: "This paper studies strategic interactions and directed search in the housing market. Building on a rich dataset of housing transactions in the Seattle area, we document that asking prices alone are not a sufficiently strong signal from sellers to generate the patterns of directed search predicted by theory. We observe instead that sellers use publicly available market valuations as an anchor point for strategic interactions. For example, we find that advertising below the market valuation leads to more virtual visits, faster selling times and a higher probability of receiving multiple offers, while advertising above obtains a higher price. We propose a theoretical model that explains these patterns of conditional directed search. In our setup, market valuations serve two goals: they help sorting buyers across house types, and they provide an anchor point for sellers' strategies within house types. More precisely, sellers set their asking price relative to the market valuation to reveal their reservation value which direct buyers to the correct seller within a house type. We explore the consequences of being over- versus underestimated for two sellers with the same reservation value and show that being over-evaluated by the market leads to both a faster sale and a higher expected price compared to being under-evaluated."
