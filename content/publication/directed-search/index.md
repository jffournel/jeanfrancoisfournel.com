abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify">Algorithm-based market valuations
  for houses, such as the Zillow’s Zestimate, impact trading outcomes in the
  housing market. Sellers who advertise an asking price below their Zestimate
  increase buyers’ search intensity, shorten their time on market, and reduce
  their sales price, irrespectively of sellers’ preferences and home
  characteristics. Using data about the home selling process on Zillow in the
  Seattle metropolitan area, we estimate the cost associated with this tradeoff
  is $3,600 (0.75%) of the house sales price for one fewer day on market.
  Despite this high cost, we show that it is still rational for a seller to
  advertise an asking price below the Zestimate if there exists a distance
  between his reservation value and the Zestimate. Our model implies that
  heterogeneity in house trading outcomes can arise from homogenous sellers’
  (mis)fortune in receiving a low or a high Zestimate.</div>'
