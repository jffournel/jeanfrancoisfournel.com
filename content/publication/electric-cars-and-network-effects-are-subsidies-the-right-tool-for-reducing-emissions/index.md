abstract: "Abstract - This paper studies the impact of the Roulez Vert program,
  which subsidized new purchases of electric vehicles in the province of Quebec,
  Canada. I explore several outcomes crucial to policymakers: how costly it is
  to replace traditional vehicles with electric or to avoid carbon emissions
  using subsidies, and the impact they have on sales, prices, and charging
  station deployment. To study these questions, I rely on structural demand and
  supply estimation methods (Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes, 1995). I build on
  Springel's (2017) methodology and propose a new model for charging station
  deployment. In my setup, county-level governments choose where and how many
  stations to install in their region to provide charging capacity to EV owners.
  My findings suggest the subsidy program to be responsible for 45.7% of
  electric vehicle sales and 27.7% of charging stations installed between 2012
  and 2018. I estimate abating emissions in this way to have an average cost
  $1,345 and a marginal cost of $1,541 per ton of CO2 which is significantly
  higher than current estimates for the social costs of carbon. Part of the
  reason behind these sizeable costs is that 62.1% of new electric vehicle sales
  associated with the policy came from consumers that would have chosen not to
  purchase a vehicle if no subsidy was available, suggesting that the policy
  poorly targeted the right consumers. "
