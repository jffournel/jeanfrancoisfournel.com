abstract: "This paper studies the impact of the Roulez Vert program, a policy
  that subsidized new purchases of electric vehicles in the Canadian province of
  Quebec. I explore several outcomes crucial to policymakers: how costly it is
  to replace traditional vehicles with electric ones or to avoid carbon
  emissions using subsidies, the impact they have on sales, prices, and charging
  station deployment, and how they affect consumer surplus, profits, and
  welfare. To study the effect of this program, I rely on a structural approach
  in which consumers’ demand for cars follows a discrete choice model, and
  supply is determined by multi-product firms competing on prices. I build on
  Springel (2017) methodology and propose a new model for charging station
  deployment. In my setup, county-level governments choose where and how many
  stations to install in their region to provide charging capacity to EV owners.
  My findings suggest the Roulez Vert program, which subsidizes electric vehicle
  purchases by up to $8,000, to be responsible for 45.7% of electric vehicle
  sales and 27.7% of charging stations installed between 2012 and 2018. I
  estimate reducing emissions in this way to have cost $1,345 per ton of CO2 and
  decreasing sales of fuel vehicles to have cost $39,330 per unit. Part of the
  reason behind these sizeable costs is that 62.1% of new electric vehicle sales
  associated with the policy came from consumers that would have chosen not to
  purchase a vehicle if no subsidy was available. In counterpart, gains in
  consumer and producer surpluses more than offset the total spending on the
  policy, such that the net impact on welfare is positive."
