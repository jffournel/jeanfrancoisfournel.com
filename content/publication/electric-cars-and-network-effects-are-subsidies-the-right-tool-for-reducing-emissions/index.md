  This paper studies the impact of the Roulez Vert program, which subsidized new purchases of electric vehicles in the province of Quebec, Canada. I study the impact of the program on sales, firms' pricing behavior, and charging station deployment, and estimate the cost of avoiding carbon emissions or replacing traditional vehicles with electric ones using subsidies. To evaluate the impacts of the program, I rely on a structural model in which demand follows a nested logit specification and supply is determined by multi-product firms competing on prices. I augment the model to incorporate charging station deployment. Specifically, I allow for county-level governments to choose where and how many stations to install in their region to provide charging capacity to EV owners. I find that the program explains 45.7% of electric vehicle sales and 27.7% of charging stations installed between 2012 and 2018. I estimate an average abatement cost of $1,345 and a marginal abatement cost of $1,541 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>, well above conventional estimates of the social cost of carbon emissions. Part of the reason behind these high estimated costs is that 62.1% of the additional electric vehicle sales originated from consumers that would have chosen the outside option if no subsidy was available, suggesting that the policy did not target the right consumers.
