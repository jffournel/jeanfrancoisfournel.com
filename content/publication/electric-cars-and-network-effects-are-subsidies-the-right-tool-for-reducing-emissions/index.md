abstract: "This paper studies the impact of the Roulez Vert program, which subsidized new purchases of electric vehicles in the province of Quebec, Canada. I explore several outcomes crucial to policymakers: how costly it is to avoid carbon emissions or to replace traditional vehicles with electric using subsidies, and the impact of the program on sales, firms' pricing behavior, and charging station deployment. To study these questions, I rely on a structural model in which demand follows the nested logit specification and supply is determined by multi-product firms competing on prices. I propose a new model for charging station deployment. In my setup, county-level governments choose where and how many stations to install in their region to provide charging capacity to EV owners. My findings suggest the subsidy program to be responsible for 45.7% of electric vehicle sales and 27.7% of charging stations installed between 2012 and 2018. I estimate abating emissions in this way to have an average cost of $1,345 and a marginal cost of $1,541 per ton of CO2, which is significantly higher than current estimates for the social cost of carbon. Part of the reason behind these sizeable costs is that 62.1% of the additional electric vehicle sales originated from consumers that would have chosen the outside option if no subsidy was available, suggesting that the policy poorly targeted the right consumers."
